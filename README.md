# MovieApp
An app I wrote to learn new skills and exercise old skills, thanks to other open source apps I learnt from.
This app is written in Kotlin, utilizing new Android Jetpack features such as Navigation Component, Room Persistence, Livedata and Viewmdodel Libraries extensively. Also, libraries such as Retrofit, Picasso, Gson are used. 
All movie data and images come from The Movie Database API.
